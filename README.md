# resume-website-template

## About the Project

I wanted a simple single-page website to host my resume and professional socials. So I made one! My requirements were for the webpage to be pure HTML/CSS/JS and easily hosted using Github Pages.

- Some elements and color designs inspired from [Pico.css](https://picocss.com/)

## Live Demo
